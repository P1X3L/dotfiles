# dotfiles
You will find my every day configuration using the following:

- iTerm2
- zsh with [rubby russel's oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- tmux
- vim (with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))

This is a configuration for OSX users.

I use solarized dark scheme for iTerm2. Get it here [http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
