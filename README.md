# dotfiles
You will find my every day configuration using the following:

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty) as a terminal
- fish shell
- tmux
- vim (with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))

This is a configuration for OSX / ubuntu users.

I use [base16-manager](https://github.com/base16-manager/base16-manager) to manage my terminal / vim colorschemes.
